# Surreal Estate React App

The aim for the project is to build a property search engine that will have multiple pages:

- A listings page where you can search for different properties and sort/filter the results.
- An add property page where you will add new properties.
- A property page.

Properties will access an external API created by Manchester Codes.

This project was built as part of Manchester Codes coding bootcamp, specifically the Front-End Module. It incorporates React with HTML/CSS through JSX Rendering.
